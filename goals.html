            <h3>After Highschool</h3>
            <p>After Highschool, I plan to
                attend a 2 year university at either Purdue or Rose-Hulman to try and achieve my Bachelors.
                Also, taking up as many internships and community service opportunities to help me gain more experience.

            <h3>After College</h3>
            <p>After College, I plan on still taking up internships as well as community.
                But my main focus will be aimed at using connections to score an apprenticeship or internship at a major corporation 
                like Eli Lilly, Mircosoft & Apple.

            <h3>Finish Line</h3>
            <p>When all said and done, my final goal is to be working at
                a Major corporation with a steady income as a Software Engineer.
